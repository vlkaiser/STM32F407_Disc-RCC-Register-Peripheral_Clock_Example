# STM32F407_Disc-RCC-Register-Peripheral_Clock_Example
Follow along with the development from scratch and other projects at: https://chicgeek.blogspot.com/

* Example on the STM32F407 discovery board on peripheral setup included peripheral clock enable, and read/write from peripheral registers.

* See the .docx file for additional notes and walkthrough of process and current (albiet n00b) understanding - to be revised as understanding improves.

**Needs better understanding/explanation:**
- [ ] '#define var = ((struct *) ADDRESS)'
- [ ] 'Struct *ptr;'
- [ ] 'ptr = ((struct *) ADDRESS)'
